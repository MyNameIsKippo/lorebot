Sweet and simple wrapper that helps you store all slack lore. Add the :lore: reaction to any items you want to store.  

##TODO:
- ~~Deploy lore emoji on first time init.~~ Seems like Slack doesn't allow it.
- ~~Store lore in a database of sorts.~~ https://github.com/christhompson/loredb
- Create UI to see top loremasters.
- Handle adding more than 1 trunksme reaction.
- Adding context to the lore item.
